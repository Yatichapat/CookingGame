# Apocalypse Cooker

## Description
Apocalypse Cooker is a cooking game with an apocalypse theme, where the chef opens the restaurant to send food to the 
survivors of a zombie horde in the quarantine zone around the city. The chef, who is a player, must avoid poisonous food 
that will randomly spawn when those ingredients are sent from outside. They may get infected, radiated, or expired. So 
we must try to avoid them as much as possible.
